Lab: Google Cloud Fundamentals; Getting Started with GKE

Objectives:
	-provision a kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.
	-Deploy and manage Docker containers using kubectl.

Task 1: Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster
	-place the zone you are in, in an enviromental variable called MY_ZONE
		export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a

	-Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine named webfrontend and configure it to 2 nodes
		gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2
	
	-check the version of the kubernetes you are using
		kubectl version

Task 2: Run and deploy a container
	-launch a single instance of the nginx container.
		kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10
	
	-View the pod running the nginx container
		kubectl get pods
	
	-Expose the nginx container to the Internet
		kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer

	-View the new service, where you will get an external address that shows the default home page of the Nginx browser.
		kubectl get services

	-You can also scale up the number of pods running on your service
		kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3

	-Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods
		kubectl get pods

	-Confirm that your external IP address has not changed
		kubectl get services
